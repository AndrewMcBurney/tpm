:computer: Code samples used for my Technical Presentation Milestone.

The "Technical Presentation Milestone" is a presentation that every Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo must give in their 2B term.

My presentation was titled "Transpiling Languages: the Future of Client-Side Web-Development?". In the presentation I talked about various front-end technologies and advantages and disadvantages of writing in transpiled languages.

The code in this repository was used to show the syntactic differences amongst languages discussed in the presentation.
